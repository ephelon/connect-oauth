# Connect-OAuth

Connect-OAuth is a Connect middleware designed to allow you to implement an 
OAuth 1.0a provider with relative ease.  It is based upon 
node-express-oauth-plugin by Christian Amor Kvalheim ([christkv][]).  The 
original has been heavily refactored to simplify implementation and remove any
dependance upon Express.
